# wav_AudioEditor
Mini audio editor for .wav files

You can change any options of audio files (sample rate (frequency), bitDepth, bit rate and etc.)
Also, you can compress your .wav file and reduce file size

For example, the input file is "Hymn(48000).wav" which contains a lot of samples and has about ~22 Mbytes
This code compresses that file and outputs "programWav.wav" with size ~1.0 Mbytes

In addition, code can create additional samples for "smooth playing". (programWav_uncompressed.wav)
